        As a full-stack developer at Melio, working on React-based web
        applications, I’ve seen firsthand that frontend development is as
        complex as backend work. Managing the state, ensuring responsiveness,
        and optimizing performance all contribute to the intricate challenges of
        the frontend. Every frontend framework has its inner workings,
        challenges, and nuances, and React is no different. Some of its
        mechanics require a level of understanding to be used properly, like the
        famous useEffect hook. useEffect is one of the most popular hooks
        provided by React; it allows us to synchronize the component with
        external factors/services, including fetching data, subscriptions,
        manual changes, etc, but it’s also very easily abused. In this blog
        post, I’ll discuss a few scenarios every developer should avoid and how
        the React team puts everything on the table in the new React docs
        (react.dev). Lorem1000
